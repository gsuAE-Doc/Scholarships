<h2>Plagiarism Statement</h2>

<p>For the submission of essays for consideration for scholarships from Georgia State University, both incoming and enrolled student applicants, will be held to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gsu.edu/images/Downloadables/Catalog_Undergraduate_09-10.pdf#page=84">University's Policy on Academic Honesty</a>.   As members of the academic community, students are expected to recognize and uphold standards of intellectual and academic integrity, including the submission of work that is only the product of their own efforts and not plagiarized.  Plagiarism is presenting another person's work as one's own and includes any paraphrasing or summarizing of the works of another person without acknowledgment, including the submission of another student's work as one's own.  Scholarship applicants who violate this Policy on Academic Honesty will have their applications rejected and could face further disciplinary action from the University. </p>
